I’m not talking about the “supernatural” or more exotically metaphysical parts of Buddhism—reincarnation, for example—but rather about the naturalistic parts: ideas that fall squarely within modern psychology and philosophy.

**2. I’m of course aware意识到的 that there’s no one Buddhism, but rather various Buddhist traditions传统, which differ相异 on all kinds of doctrines教义. But this book focuses on a kind of “common core”—fundamental基本的 ideas that are found across the major Buddhist traditions, even if they get different degrees of emphasis强调, and may assume假定 somewhat有点 different form, in different traditions.**

**3. I’m not getting into super-fine-grained纹理 parts of Buddhist psychology and philosophy. For example, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a collection of early Buddhist texts, asserts断言 that there are eighty-nine kinds of consciousness意识, twelve of which are unwholesome不健康的. You may be relieved to hear that this book will spend no time trying to evaluate that claim.**

**4. I realize that true is a trick棘手的y word, and asserting the truth of anything, certainly including deep ideas in philosophy or psychology, is a tricky business. In fact, one big lesson from Buddhism is to be suspicious可疑的 of the intuition直觉 that your ordinary way of perceiving察觉 the world brings you the truth about it. Some early Buddhist writings go so far as to raise doubts about whether such a thing as “truth” ultimately根本上 exists. On the other hand, the Buddha, in his most famous sermon布道, lays奠定 out what are commonly called “The Four Noble Truths,”四圣谛 so it’s not as if the word true has no place in discussions of Buddhist thought. In any event, I’ll try to proceed继续 with appropriate适当的 humility谦卑 and nuance细微的差别 as I make my argument that Buddhism’s diagnosis诊断 of the human predicament困境 is fundamentally从根本上讲 correct, and that its prescription处方 is deeply valid and urgently急迫地 important.**

**5. Asserting断言 the validity有效性 of core核心 Buddhist ideas doesn’t necessarily say anything, one way or the other, about other spiritual or philosophical traditions. There will sometimes be logical tension矛盾 between a Buddhist idea and an idea in another tradition, but often there won’t be. The Dalai Lama has said, “Don’t try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a better Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are.”—Robert Wright**

## 1 Taking the Red Pill

**At the risk of冒着…危险 overdramatizing过分戏剧性地表达 the human condition状况: Have you ever seen the movie The Matrix矩阵?黑客帝国**

**It’s about a guy named Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), who discovers that he’s been inhabiting居住 a dream world. The life he thought he was living is actually an elaborate复杂的 hallucination幻觉. He’s having that hallucination while, unbeknownst不知不觉 to him, his actual physical body is inside a gooey黏黏糊糊的, coffin棺材-size pod豆荚—one among many pods, rows排 and rows of pods, each pod containing a human being absorbed被…吸引住 in a dream. These people have been put in their pods by robot overlords霸主 and given dream lives as pacifiers安抚奶嘴.**

**The choice faced by Neo—to keep living a delusion错觉 or wake up to reality—is famously captured捕获 in the movie’s “red pill” scene场景. Neo has been contacted by rebels造反者 who have entered his dream (or, strictly严格地 speaking, whose avatars虚拟化身 have entered his dream). Their leader, Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), explains the situation to Neo: “You are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage奴役, into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch—a prison for your mind.” The prison is called the Matrix, but there’s no way to explain to Neo what the Matrix ultimately最终 is. The only way to get the whole picture, says Morpheus, is “to see it for yourself.” He offers Neo two pills, a red one and a blue one. Neo can take the blue pill and return to his dream world, or take the red pill and break through the shroud遮蔽 of delusion. Neo chooses the red pill.**

**That’s a pretty stark严酷的 choice: a life of delusion and bondage or a life of insight领悟 and freedom. In fact, it’s a choice so dramatic戏剧性的 that you’d think a Hollywood movie is exactly where it belongs—that the choices we really get to make about how to live our lives are less momentous重大的 than this, more pedestrian缺乏想象的. Yet when that movie came out, a number of people saw it as mirroring反映 a choice they had actually made.**

**The people I’m thinking about are what you might call Western Buddhists, people in the United States and other Western countries who, for the most part, didn’t grow up Buddhist but at some point adopted采纳 Buddhism. At least they adopted a version版本 of Buddhism, a version that had been stripped剥去 of some supernatural elements元素 typically通常 found in Asian Buddhism, such as belief in reincarnation转世 and in various deities神灵. This Western Buddhism centers集中 on a part of Buddhist practice that in Asia is more common among monks僧侣 than among laypeople俗人: meditation冥想, along with immersion沉浸 in Buddhist philosophy. (Two of the most common Western conceptions构想 of Buddhism—that it’s atheistic无神论者 and that it revolves环绕 around meditation—are wrong; most Asian Buddhists do believe in gods, though not an omnipotent万能的 creator God, and don’t meditate.)**

**These Western Buddhists, long before they watched The Matrix, had become convinced确信 that the world as they had once seen it was a kind of illusion幻觉—not an out-and-out彻头彻尾 hallucination幻觉 but a seriously warped扭曲的 picture of reality that in turn warped their approach方法 to life, with bad consequences for them and the people around them. Now they felt that, thanks to meditation冥想 and Buddhist philosophy, they were seeing things more clearly. Among these people, The Matrix seemed an apt恰当的 allegory寓言 of the transition变迁 they’d undergone经受, and so became known as a “dharma达摩 movie.” The word dharma has several meanings, including the Buddha’s teachings and the path成功的途径 that Buddhists should tread in response to those teachings. In the wake of 随着…而来The Matrix, a new shorthand速记 for “I follow the dharma” came into currency流行: “I took the red pill.”**

**I saw The Matrix in 1999, right after it came out, and some months later I learned that I had a kind of connection to it. The movie’s directors, the Wachowski siblings兄弟姐妹, had given Keanu Reeves three books to read in preparation for playing Neo. One of them was a book I had written a few years earlier, The Moral道德的 Animal: Evolutionary进化的 Psychology and Everyday Life.**

**I’m not sure what kind of link the directors saw between my book and The Matrix. But I know what kind of link I see. Evolutionary psychology can be described in various ways, and here’s one way I had described it in my book: It is the study of how the human brain was designed—by natural selection—to mislead us, even enslave us.**

**Don’t get me wrong: natural selection has its virtues优点美德, and I’d rather be created by it than not be created at all—which, so far as I can tell, are the two options this universe offers. Being a product of evolution is by no means entirely a story of enslavement奴役 and delusion错觉妄想. Our evolved进化 brains empower使控制局势 us in many ways, and they often bless us with a basically accurate精确的 view of reality.**

**Still, ultimately根本上, natural selection cares about only one thing (or, I should say, “cares”—in quotes引号—about only one thing, since natural selection is just a blind process过程, not a conscious有意识的 designer). And that one thing is getting genes into the next generation. Genetically遗传上地 based traits特点 that in the past contributed贡献 to genetic遗传的 proliferation激增 have flourished繁荣, while traits that didn’t have fallen by the wayside. And the traits that have survived this test include mental思想的 traits—structures结构 and algorithms算法 that are built into the brain and shape our everyday experience. So if you ask the question “What kinds of perceptions感知 and thoughts and feelings guide us through life each day?” the answer, at the most basic level, isn’t “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that give us an accurate精确的 picture of reality.” No, at the most basic level the answer is “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that helped our ancestors祖先 get genes into the next generation.” Whether those thoughts and feelings and perceptions give us a true view of reality is, strictly严格地 speaking, beside the point. As a result, they sometimes don’t. Our brains are designed to, among other things, delude欺骗 us.**

**Not that there’s anything wrong with that! Some of my happiest moments have come from delusion—believing, for example, that the Tooth Fairy would pay me a visit after I lost a tooth. But delusion can also produce bad moments. And I don’t just mean moments that, in retrospect回顾, are obviously delusional妄想的, like horrible nightmares. I also mean moments that you might not think of as delusional, such as lying awake at night with anxiety焦虑. Or feeling hopeless, even depressed抑郁的, for days on end. Or feeling bursts爆发 of hatred仇恨 toward people, bursts that may actually feel good for a moment but slowly corrode腐蚀 your character. Or feeling bursts of hatred toward yourself. Or feeling greedy贪婪的, feeling a compulsion强迫 to buy things or eat things or drink things well beyond the point where your well-being幸福 is served.**

**Though these feelings—anxiety/æŋˈzaɪəti/, despair绝望, hatred, greed贪婪—aren’t delusional the way a nightmare is delusional, if you examine them closely, you’ll see that they have elements元素 of delusion, elements you’d be better off without.**

**And if you think you would be better off, imagine how the whole world would be. After all, feelings like despair and hatred and greed can foster促进 wars and atrocities暴行. So if what I’m saying is true—if these basic sources of human suffering and human cruelty残忍 are indeed的确 in large part the product of delusion—there is value in exposing暴露 this delusion to the light.**

**Sounds logical, right? But here’s a problem that I started to appreciate欣赏 shortly after I wrote my book about evolutionary进化的 psychology: the exact准确的 value of exposing暴露 a delusion to the light depends on what kind of light you’re talking about. Sometimes understanding the ultimate最后的 source of your suffering doesn’t, by itself, help very much.**

### An Everyday Delusion

**Let’s take a simple but fundamental基本的 example: eating some junk废旧物品 food, feeling briefly短暂地 satisfied, and then, only minutes later, feeling a kind of crash崩溃 and maybe a hunger for more junk food. This is a good example to start with for two reasons.**

**First, it illustrates说明 how subtle不易察觉的 our delusions can be. There’s no point in the course of eating a six-pack of small powdered-sugar doughnuts甜甜圈 when you’re believing that you’re the messiah弥赛亚 or that foreign agents are conspiring密谋 to assassinate暗杀 you. And that’s true of many sources of delusion that I’ll discuss in this book: they’re more about illusion—about things not being quite what they seem—than about delusion in the more dramatic戏剧性的 sense of that word. Still, by the end of the book, I’ll have argued that all of these illusions do add up to a very large-scale规模 warping扭曲 of reality, a disorientation迷失方向 that is as significant重要的 and consequential相应的 as out-and-out delusion.**

**The second reason junk food is a good example to start with is that it’s fundamental根本法则/基本的 to the Buddha’s teachings. Okay, it can’t be literally字面上 fundamental基本的 to the Buddha’s teachings, because 2,500 years ago, when the Buddha taught, junk food as we know it didn’t exist. What’s fundamental to the Buddha’s teachings is the general全体的 dynamic动态 of being powerfully drawn使感兴趣 to sensory感觉的 pleasure that winds up结束 being fleeting转瞬即逝的 at best充其量. One of the Buddha’s main messages was that the pleasures we seek evaporate蒸发/衰减 quickly and leave us thirsting口渴的 for more. We spend our time looking for the next gratifying使满意 thing—the next powdered-sugar doughnut甜甜圈, the next sexual encounter遭遇, the next status-enhancing增强 promotion晋升, the next online purchase购买. But the thrill兴奋 always fades逐渐消失, and it always leaves us wanting more. The old Rolling Stones lyric歌词 “I can’t get no satisfaction” is, according to Buddhism, the human condition状态. Indeed, though the Buddha is famous for asserting断言 that life is pervaded弥漫 by suffering, some scholars/ˈskɑlərz/学者 say that’s an incomplete不完整的 rendering扮演/翻译 of his message and that the word translated as “suffering,” dukkha/ˈduːkə/苦, could, for some purposes, be translated as “unsatisfactoriness不满意.”**

**So what exactly is the illusory虚幻的 part of pursuing追求 doughnuts or sex or consumer消费者 goods or a promotion晋升? There are different illusions associated相关的 with different pursuits追求, but for now we can focus on one illusion that’s common to these things: the overestimation高估 of how much happiness they’ll bring. Again, by itself this is delusional only in a subtle不易察觉的 sense. If I asked you whether you thought that getting that next promotion, or getting an A on that next exam, or eating that next powdered-sugar doughnut/ˈdoʊnʌt/ would bring you eternal不朽的 bliss幸福, you’d say no, obviously not. On the other hand, we do often pursue追求 such things with, at the very least, an unbalanced view of the future. We spend more time envisioning设想 the perks补贴 that a promotion will bring than envisioning the headaches it will bring. And there may be an unspoken不言而喻的 sense that once we’ve achieved this long-sought寻求 goal, once we’ve reached the summit顶点, we’ll be able to relax, or at least things will be enduringly持久地 better. Similarly, when we see that doughnut sitting there, we immediately imagine how good it tastes, not how intensely强烈的 we’ll want another doughnut only moments after eating it, or how we’ll feel a bit tired or agitated激动的 later, when the sugar rush糖潮 subsides消退.**

### Why Pleasure Fades

**It doesn’t take a rocket火箭 scientist to explain why this sort of distortion扭曲 would be built into human anticipation期待. It just takes an evolutionary进化的 biologist—or, for that matter, anyone willing to spend a little time thinking about how evolution works.**

**Here’s the basic logic. We were “designed” by natural selection to do certain things that helped our ancestors祖先 get their genes into the next generation—things like eating, having sex, earning the esteem尊重 of other people, and outdoing胜过 rivals对手. I put “designed” in quotation引用 marks because, again, natural selection isn’t a conscious有意识的, intelligent聪明的 designer but an unconscious process过程. Still, natural selection does create organisms/ˈɔrgəˌnɪzəmz/生物 that look as if they’re the product产品 of a conscious designer, a designer who kept fiddling摆弄/伪造 with them to make them effective gene propagators/ˈprɑːpəɡeɪtərz/传播者. So, as a kind of thought experiment, it’s legitimate正当合理的 to think of natural selection as a “designer” and put yourself in its shoes and ask: If you were designing organisms to be good at spreading their genes, how would you get them to pursue贯彻 the goals that further this cause? In other words, granted that就算… eating, having sex, impressing使钦佩 peers同龄人, and besting战胜 rivals对手 helped our ancestors spread their genes, how exactly would you design their brains to get them to pursue these goals? I submit主张 that at least three basic principles of design would make sense:**
