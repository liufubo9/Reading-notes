**1. I’m not talking about the “supernatural” or more exotically metaphysical parts of Buddhism—reincarnation, for example—but rather about the naturalistic parts: ideas that fall squarely within modern psychology and philosophy. That said, I am talking about some of Buddhism’s more extraordinary, even radical, claims—claims that, if you take them seriously, could revolutionize your view of yourself and of the world. This book is intended to get you to take these claims seriously.**

**2. I’m of course aware意识到的 that there’s no one Buddhism, but rather various Buddhist traditions传统, which differ相异 on all kinds of doctrines教义. But this book focuses on a kind of “common core”—fundamental基本的 ideas that are found across the major Buddhist traditions, even if they get different degrees of emphasis强调, and may assume假定 somewhat有点 different form, in different traditions.**

**3. I’m not getting into super-fine-grained纹理 parts of Buddhist psychology and philosophy. For example, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a collection of early Buddhist texts, asserts断言 that there are eighty-nine kinds of consciousness意识, twelve of which are unwholesome不健康的. You may be relieved to hear that this book will spend no time trying to evaluate that claim.**

**4. I realize that true is a trick棘手的y word, and asserting the truth of anything, certainly including deep ideas in philosophy or psychology, is a tricky business. In fact, one big lesson from Buddhism is to be suspicious可疑的 of the intuition直觉 that your ordinary way of perceiving察觉 the world brings you the truth about it. Some early Buddhist writings go so far as to raise doubts about whether such a thing as “truth” ultimately根本上 exists. On the other hand, the Buddha, in his most famous sermon布道, lays奠定 out what are commonly called “The Four Noble Truths,”四圣谛 so it’s not as if the word true has no place in discussions of Buddhist thought. In any event, I’ll try to proceed继续 with appropriate适当的 humility谦卑 and nuance细微的差别 as I make my argument that Buddhism’s diagnosis诊断 of the human predicament困境 is fundamentally从根本上讲 correct, and that its prescription处方 is deeply valid and urgently急迫地 important.**

**5. Asserting断言 the validity有效性 of core核心 Buddhist ideas doesn’t necessarily say anything, one way or the other, about other spiritual or philosophical traditions. There will sometimes be logical tension矛盾 between a Buddhist idea and an idea in another tradition, but often there won’t be. The Dalai Lama has said, “Don’t try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a better Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are.”—Robert Wright**

## 1 Taking the Red Pill

**At the risk of冒着…危险 overdramatizing过分戏剧性地表达 the human condition状况: Have you ever seen the movie The Matrix矩阵?黑客帝国**

**It’s about a guy named Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), who discovers that he’s been inhabiting居住 a dream world. The life he thought he was living is actually an elaborate复杂的 hallucination幻觉. He’s having that hallucination while, unbeknownst不知不觉 to him, his actual physical body is inside a gooey黏黏糊糊的, coffin棺材-size pod豆荚—one among many pods, rows排 and rows of pods, each pod containing a human being absorbed被…吸引住 in a dream. These people have been put in their pods by robot overlords霸主 and given dream lives as pacifiers安抚奶嘴.**

**The choice faced by Neo—to keep living a delusion错觉 or wake up to reality—is famously captured捕获 in the movie’s “red pill” scene场景. Neo has been contacted by rebels造反者 who have entered his dream (or, strictly严格地 speaking, whose avatars虚拟化身 have entered his dream). Their leader, Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), explains the situation to Neo: “You are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage奴役, into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch—a prison for your mind.” The prison is called the Matrix, but there’s no way to explain to Neo what the Matrix ultimately最终 is. The only way to get the whole picture, says Morpheus, is “to see it for yourself.” He offers Neo two pills, a red one and a blue one. Neo can take the blue pill and return to his dream world, or take the red pill and break through the shroud遮蔽 of delusion. Neo chooses the red pill.**

**That’s a pretty stark严酷的 choice: a life of delusion and bondage or a life of insight领悟 and freedom. In fact, it’s a choice so dramatic戏剧性的 that you’d think a Hollywood movie is exactly where it belongs—that the choices we really get to make about how to live our lives are less momentous重大的 than this, more pedestrian缺乏想象的. Yet when that movie came out, a number of people saw it as mirroring反映 a choice they had actually made.**

**The people I’m thinking about are what you might call Western Buddhists, people in the United States and other Western countries who, for the most part, didn’t grow up Buddhist but at some point adopted采纳 Buddhism. At least they adopted a version版本 of Buddhism, a version that had been stripped剥去 of some supernatural elements元素 typically通常 found in Asian Buddhism, such as belief in reincarnation转世 and in various deities神灵. This Western Buddhism centers集中 on a part of Buddhist practice that in Asia is more common among monks僧侣 than among laypeople俗人: meditation冥想, along with immersion沉浸 in Buddhist philosophy. (Two of the most common Western conceptions构想 of Buddhism—that it’s atheistic无神论者 and that it revolves环绕 around meditation—are wrong; most Asian Buddhists do believe in gods, though not an omnipotent万能的 creator God, and don’t meditate.)**

**These Western Buddhists, long before they watched The Matrix, had become convinced that the world as they had once seen it was a kind of illusion—not an out-and-out hallucination but a seriously warped picture of reality that in turn warped their approach to life, with bad consequences for them and the people around them. Now they felt that, thanks to meditation and Buddhist philosophy, they were seeing things more clearly. Among these people, The Matrix seemed an apt allegory of the transition they’d undergone, and so became known as a “dharma movie.” The word dharma has several meanings, including the Buddha’s teachings and the path that Buddhists should tread in response to those teachings. In the wake of The Matrix, a new shorthand for “I follow the dharma” came into currency: “I took the red pill.”**
