**2. I’m of course aware意识到的 that there’s no one Buddhism, but rather various Buddhist traditions传统, which differ相异 on all kinds of doctrines教义. But this book focuses on a kind of “common core”—fundamental基本的 ideas that are found across the major Buddhist traditions, even if they get different degrees of emphasis强调, and may assume假定 somewhat有点 different form, in different traditions.**

**3. I’m not getting into super-fine-grained纹理 parts of Buddhist psychology and philosophy. For example, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a collection of early Buddhist texts, asserts断言 that there are eighty-nine kinds of consciousness意识, twelve of which are unwholesome不健康的. You may be relieved to hear that this book will spend no time trying to evaluate that claim.**

**4. I realize that true is a trick棘手的y word, and asserting the truth of anything, certainly including deep ideas in philosophy or psychology, is a tricky business. In fact, one big lesson from Buddhism is to be suspicious可疑的 of the intuition直觉 that your ordinary way of perceiving察觉 the world brings you the truth about it. Some early Buddhist writings go so far as to raise doubts about whether such a thing as “truth” ultimately根本上 exists. On the other hand, the Buddha, in his most famous sermon布道, lays奠定 out what are commonly called “The Four Noble Truths,”四圣谛 so it’s not as if the word true has no place in discussions of Buddhist thought. In any event, I’ll try to proceed继续 with appropriate适当的 humility谦卑 and nuance细微的差别 as I make my argument that Buddhism’s diagnosis诊断 of the human predicament困境 is fundamentally从根本上讲 correct, and that its prescription处方 is deeply valid and urgently急迫地 important.**

**5. Asserting断言 the validity有效性 of core核心 Buddhist ideas doesn’t necessarily say anything, one way or the other, about other spiritual or philosophical traditions. There will sometimes be logical tension矛盾 between a Buddhist idea and an idea in another tradition, but often there won’t be. The Dalai Lama has said, “Don’t try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a better Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are.”—Robert Wright**

## 1 Taking the Red Pill

**At the risk of冒着…危险 overdramatizing过分戏剧性地表达 the human condition状况: Have you ever seen the movie The Matrix矩阵?黑客帝国**

**It’s about a guy named Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), who discovers that he’s been inhabiting居住 a dream world. The life he thought he was living is actually an elaborate复杂的 hallucination幻觉. He’s having that hallucination while, unbeknownst不知不觉 to him, his actual physical body is inside a gooey黏黏糊糊的, coffin棺材-size pod豆荚—one among many pods, rows排 and rows of pods, each pod containing a human being absorbed被…吸引住 in a dream. These people have been put in their pods by robot overlords霸主 and given dream lives as pacifiers安抚奶嘴.**

**The choice faced by Neo—to keep living a delusion错觉 or wake up to reality—is famously captured捕获 in the movie’s “red pill” scene场景. Neo has been contacted by rebels造反者 who have entered his dream (or, strictly严格地 speaking, whose avatars虚拟化身 have entered his dream). Their leader, Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), explains the situation to Neo: “You are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage奴役, into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch—a prison for your mind.” The prison is called the Matrix, but there’s no way to explain to Neo what the Matrix ultimately最终 is. The only way to get the whole picture, says Morpheus, is “to see it for yourself.” He offers Neo two pills, a red one and a blue one. Neo can take the blue pill and return to his dream world, or take the red pill and break through the shroud遮蔽 of delusion. Neo chooses the red pill.**

**That’s a pretty stark严酷的 choice: a life of delusion and bondage or a life of insight领悟 and freedom. In fact, it’s a choice so dramatic戏剧性的 that you’d think a Hollywood movie is exactly where it belongs—that the choices we really get to make about how to live our lives are less momentous重大的 than this, more pedestrian缺乏想象的. Yet when that movie came out, a number of people saw it as mirroring反映 a choice they had actually made.**

**The people I’m thinking about are what you might call Western Buddhists, people in the United States and other Western countries who, for the most part, didn’t grow up Buddhist but at some point adopted采纳 Buddhism. At least they adopted a version版本 of Buddhism, a version that had been stripped剥去 of some supernatural elements元素 typically通常 found in Asian Buddhism, such as belief in reincarnation转世 and in various deities神灵. This Western Buddhism centers集中 on a part of Buddhist practice that in Asia is more common among monks僧侣 than among laypeople俗人: meditation冥想, along with immersion沉浸 in Buddhist philosophy. (Two of the most common Western conceptions构想 of Buddhism—that it’s atheistic无神论者 and that it revolves环绕 around meditation—are wrong; most Asian Buddhists do believe in gods, though not an omnipotent万能的 creator God, and don’t meditate.)**

**These Western Buddhists, long before they watched The Matrix, had become convinced确信 that the world as they had once seen it was a kind of illusion幻觉—not an out-and-out彻头彻尾 hallucination幻觉 but a seriously warped扭曲的 picture of reality that in turn warped their approach方法 to life, with bad consequences for them and the people around them. Now they felt that, thanks to meditation冥想 and Buddhist philosophy, they were seeing things more clearly. Among these people, The Matrix seemed an apt恰当的 allegory寓言 of the transition变迁 they’d undergone经受, and so became known as a “dharma达摩 movie.” The word dharma has several meanings, including the Buddha’s teachings and the path成功的途径 that Buddhists should tread in response to those teachings. In the wake of 随着…而来The Matrix, a new shorthand速记 for “I follow the dharma” came into currency流行: “I took the red pill.”**

**I saw The Matrix in 1999, right after it came out, and some months later I learned that I had a kind of connection to it. The movie’s directors, the Wachowski siblings兄弟姐妹, had given Keanu Reeves three books to read in preparation for playing Neo. One of them was a book I had written a few years earlier, The Moral道德的 Animal: Evolutionary进化的 Psychology and Everyday Life.**

**I’m not sure what kind of link the directors saw between my book and The Matrix. But I know what kind of link I see. Evolutionary psychology can be described in various ways, and here’s one way I had described it in my book: It is the study of how the human brain was designed—by natural selection—to mislead us, even enslave us.**

**Don’t get me wrong: natural selection has its virtues优点美德, and I’d rather be created by it than not be created at all—which, so far as I can tell, are the two options this universe offers. Being a product of evolution is by no means entirely a story of enslavement奴役 and delusion错觉妄想. Our evolved进化 brains empower使控制局势 us in many ways, and they often bless us with a basically accurate精确的 view of reality.**

**Still, ultimately根本上, natural selection cares about only one thing (or, I should say, “cares”—in quotes引号—about only one thing, since natural selection is just a blind process过程, not a conscious有意识的 designer). And that one thing is getting genes into the next generation. Genetically遗传上地 based traits特点 that in the past contributed贡献 to genetic遗传的 proliferation激增 have flourished繁荣, while traits that didn’t have fallen by the wayside. And the traits that have survived this test include mental思想的 traits—structures结构 and algorithms算法 that are built into the brain and shape our everyday experience. So if you ask the question “What kinds of perceptions感知 and thoughts and feelings guide us through life each day?” the answer, at the most basic level, isn’t “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that give us an accurate精确的 picture of reality.” No, at the most basic level the answer is “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that helped our ancestors祖先 get genes into the next generation.” Whether those thoughts and feelings and perceptions give us a true view of reality is, strictly严格地 speaking, beside the point. As a result, they sometimes don’t. Our brains are designed to, among other things, delude欺骗 us.**

**Not that there’s anything wrong with that! Some of my happiest moments have come from delusion—believing, for example, that the Tooth Fairy would pay me a visit after I lost a tooth. But delusion can also produce bad moments. And I don’t just mean moments that, in retrospect回顾, are obviously delusional妄想的, like horrible nightmares. I also mean moments that you might not think of as delusional, such as lying awake at night with anxiety焦虑. Or feeling hopeless, even depressed抑郁的, for days on end. Or feeling bursts爆发 of hatred仇恨 toward people, bursts that may actually feel good for a moment but slowly corrode腐蚀 your character. Or feeling bursts of hatred toward yourself. Or feeling greedy贪婪的, feeling a compulsion强迫 to buy things or eat things or drink things well beyond the point where your well-being幸福 is served.**

**Though these feelings—anxiety/æŋˈzaɪəti/, despair绝望, hatred, greed贪婪—aren’t delusional the way a nightmare is delusional, if you examine them closely, you’ll see that they have elements元素 of delusion, elements you’d be better off without.**

**And if you think you would be better off, imagine how the whole world would be. After all, feelings like despair and hatred and greed can foster促进 wars and atrocities暴行. So if what I’m saying is true—if these basic sources of human suffering and human cruelty残忍 are indeed的确 in large part the product of delusion—there is value in exposing暴露 this delusion to the light.**

**Sounds logical, right? But here’s a problem that I started to appreciate欣赏 shortly after I wrote my book about evolutionary进化的 psychology: the exact准确的 value of exposing暴露 a delusion to the light depends on what kind of light you’re talking about. Sometimes understanding the ultimate最后的 source of your suffering doesn’t, by itself, help very much.**

### An Everyday Delusion

**Let’s take a simple but fundamental基本的 example: eating some junk废旧物品 food, feeling briefly短暂地 satisfied, and then, only minutes later, feeling a kind of crash崩溃 and maybe a hunger for more junk food. This is a good example to start with for two reasons.**

**First, it illustrates说明 how subtle不易察觉的 our delusions can be. There’s no point in the course of eating a six-pack of small powdered-sugar doughnuts甜甜圈 when you’re believing that you’re the messiah弥赛亚 or that foreign agents are conspiring密谋 to assassinate暗杀 you. And that’s true of many sources of delusion that I’ll discuss in this book: they’re more about illusion—about things not being quite what they seem—than about delusion in the more dramatic戏剧性的 sense of that word. Still, by the end of the book, I’ll have argued that all of these illusions do add up to a very large-scale规模 warping扭曲 of reality, a disorientation迷失方向 that is as significant重要的 and consequential相应的 as out-and-out delusion.**

**The second reason junk food is a good example to start with is that it’s fundamental根本法则/基本的 to the Buddha’s teachings. Okay, it can’t be literally字面上 fundamental基本的 to the Buddha’s teachings, because 2,500 years ago, when the Buddha taught, junk food as we know it didn’t exist. What’s fundamental to the Buddha’s teachings is the general全体的 dynamic动态 of being powerfully drawn使感兴趣 to sensory感觉的 pleasure that winds up结束 being fleeting转瞬即逝的 at best充其量. One of the Buddha’s main messages was that the pleasures we seek evaporate蒸发/衰减 quickly and leave us thirsting口渴的 for more. We spend our time looking for the next gratifying使满意 thing—the next powdered-sugar doughnut甜甜圈, the next sexual encounter遭遇, the next status-enhancing增强 promotion晋升, the next online purchase购买. But the thrill兴奋 always fades逐渐消失, and it always leaves us wanting more. The old Rolling Stones lyric歌词 “I can’t get no satisfaction” is, according to Buddhism, the human condition状态. Indeed, though the Buddha is famous for asserting断言 that life is pervaded弥漫 by suffering, some scholars/ˈskɑlərz/学者 say that’s an incomplete不完整的 rendering扮演/翻译 of his message and that the word translated as “suffering,” dukkha/ˈduːkə/苦, could, for some purposes, be translated as “unsatisfactoriness不满意.”**

**So what exactly is the illusory虚幻的 part of pursuing追求 doughnuts or sex or consumer消费者 goods or a promotion晋升? There are different illusions associated相关的 with different pursuits追求, but for now we can focus on one illusion that’s common to these things: the overestimation高估 of how much happiness they’ll bring. Again, by itself this is delusional only in a subtle不易察觉的 sense. If I asked you whether you thought that getting that next promotion, or getting an A on that next exam, or eating that next powdered-sugar doughnut/ˈdoʊnʌt/ would bring you eternal不朽的 bliss幸福, you’d say no, obviously not. On the other hand, we do often pursue追求 such things with, at the very least, an unbalanced view of the future. We spend more time envisioning设想 the perks补贴 that a promotion will bring than envisioning the headaches it will bring. And there may be an unspoken不言而喻的 sense that once we’ve achieved this long-sought寻求 goal, once we’ve reached the summit顶点, we’ll be able to relax, or at least things will be enduringly持久地 better. Similarly, when we see that doughnut sitting there, we immediately imagine how good it tastes, not how intensely强烈的 we’ll want another doughnut only moments after eating it, or how we’ll feel a bit tired or agitated激动的 later, when the sugar rush糖潮 subsides消退.**

### Why Pleasure Fades

**It doesn’t take a rocket火箭 scientist to explain why this sort of distortion扭曲 would be built into human anticipation期待. It just takes an evolutionary进化的 biologist—or, for that matter, anyone willing to spend a little time thinking about how evolution works.**

**Here’s the basic logic. We were “designed” by natural selection to do certain things that helped our ancestors祖先 get their genes into the next generation—things like eating, having sex, earning the esteem尊重 of other people, and outdoing胜过 rivals对手. I put “designed” in quotation引用 marks because, again, natural selection isn’t a conscious有意识的, intelligent聪明的 designer but an unconscious process过程. Still, natural selection does create organisms/ˈɔrgəˌnɪzəmz/生物 that look as if they’re the product产品 of a conscious designer, a designer who kept fiddling摆弄/伪造 with them to make them effective gene propagators/ˈprɑːpəɡeɪtərz/传播者. So, as a kind of thought experiment, it’s legitimate正当合理的 to think of natural selection as a “designer” and put yourself in its shoes and ask: If you were designing organisms to be good at spreading their genes, how would you get them to pursue贯彻 the goals that further this cause? In other words, granted that就算… eating, having sex, impressing使钦佩 peers同龄人, and besting战胜 rivals对手 helped our ancestors spread their genes, how exactly would you design their brains to get them to pursue these goals? I submit主张 that at least three basic principles of design would make sense:**

**1. Achieving these goals should bring pleasure, since animals, including humans, tend to pursue things that bring pleasure.**

**2. The pleasure shouldn’t last forever. After all, if the pleasure didn’t subside减弱, we’d never seek寻找 it again; our first meal would be our last, because hunger would never return. So too with sex: a single act of intercourse交往, and then a lifetime of lying there basking晒太阳 in the afterglow余辉. That’s no way to get lots of genes into the next generation!**

**3. The animal’s brain should focus more on (1), the fact that pleasure will accompany陪同 the reaching of a goal, than on (2), the fact that the pleasure will dissipate消散 shortly thereafter之后. After all, if you focus on (1), you’ll pursue things like food and sex and social status with unalloyed纯粹的 gusto热情, whereas鉴于 if you focus on (2), you could start feeling ambivalence矛盾心理. You might, for example, start asking what the point is of so fiercely激烈的 pursuing追求 pleasure if the pleasure will wear off逐渐消失 shortly after you get it and leave you hungering for more. Before you know it, you’ll be full of ennui/ɑːnˈwiː/无聊 and wishing you’d majored主修 in philosophy.**

**If you put these three principles of design together, you get a pretty plausible看似合理的 explanation of the human predicament尴尬的处境/困境 as diagnosed by the Buddha. Yes, as he said, pleasure is fleeting转瞬即逝的, and, yes, this leaves us recurrently/rɪˈkɜːrəntli/ dissatisfied. And the reason is that pleasure is designed by natural selection to evaporate蒸发/衰减 so that the ensuing接踵而来的 dissatisfaction will get us to pursue追求 more pleasure. Natural selection doesn’t “want” us to be happy, after all; it just “wants” us to be productive富有成效的, in its narrow狭窄的 sense（狭义） of productive. And the way to make us productive is to make the anticipation期待 of pleasure very strong but the pleasure itself not very long-lasting.**

**Scientists can watch this logic play out at the biochemical生物化学 level by observing dopamine/ˈdoʊpəmiːn/多巴胺, a neurotransmitter/ˈnʊroʊtrænzmɪtər/神经递质 that is correlated相互关联影响 with pleasure and the anticipation/ænˌtɪsɪˈpeɪʃn/期待 of pleasure. In one seminal影响深远的 study, they took monkeys and monitored/ˈmɑːnɪtərd/监控 dopamine-generating生成 neurons/ˈnʊrɑnz/神经元 as drops of sweet juice fell onto the monkeys’ tongues. Predictably可以预见，, dopamine was released right after the juice touched the tongue. But then the monkeys were trained to expect预料 drops of juice after a light turned on. As the trials试验/实验 proceeded进行, more and more of the dopamine came when the light turned on, and less and less came after the juice hit the tongue.**

**We have no way of knowing for sure what it felt like to be one of those monkeys, but it would seem that, as time passed, there was more in the way of anticipating/ænˈtɪsɪpeɪtɪŋ/预期 the pleasure that would come from the sweetness令人愉快/甜蜜, yet less in the way of pleasure actually coming from the sweetness. To translate this conjecture猜想 into everyday human terms术语:**

**If you encounter与…邂逅 a new kind of pleasure—if, say, you’ve somehow不知怎地 gone your whole life without eating a powdered粉状-sugar doughnut, and somebody hands you one and suggests you try it—you’ll get a big blast爆炸 of dopamine after the taste of the doughnut sinks下沉 in. But later, once you’re a confirmed证实 powdered/ˈpaʊdərd/-sugar-doughnut eater, the lion’s share of the dopamine spike尖峰 comes before you actually bite咬 into the doughnut, as you’re staring凝视 longingly渴望地 at it; the amount that comes after the bite is much less than the amount you got after that first, blissful幸福的 bite into a powdered-sugar doughnut. The pre-bite咬前 dopamine blast you’re now getting is the promise of more bliss, and the post-bite咬后 drop减少 in dopamine is, in a way, the breaking of the promise—or, at least, it’s a kind of biochemical acknowledgment致谢 that there was some overpromising过分夸耀. To the extent程度 that you bought the promise—anticipated预期的 greater pleasure than would be delivered交付 by the consumption消耗 itself—you have been, if not deluded哄骗 in the strong sense of that term, at least misled误导.**

**Kind of cruel残酷的, in a way—but what do you expect预料 from natural selection? Its job is to build machines that spread genes, and if that means programming some measure测量 of illusion into the machines, then illusion there will be.**

### Unhelpful Insights

**So this is one kind of light science can shed on披上 an illusion. Call it “Darwinian达尔文的 light.” By looking at things from the point of view of natural selection, we see why the illusion would be built into us, and we have more reason than ever to see that it is an illusion. But—and this is the main point of this little digression/daɪˈɡreʃ.ən/离题—this kind of light is of limited value if your goal is to actually liberate解放 yourself from the illusion.**

**Don’t believe me? Try this simple experiment: (1) Reflect on反省/思考 the fact that our lust强烈欲望 for doughnuts and other sweet things is a kind of illusion—that the lust implicitly含蓄地 promises承诺 more enduring持久的 pleasure than will result from succumbing屈服 to it, while blinding致盲 us to the letdown失望 that may ensue接踵而至. (2) As you’re reflecting on this fact, hold a powdered-sugar doughnut six inches from your face. Do you feel the lust for it magically weakening弱化? Not if you’re like me, no.**

**This is what I discovered after immersing沉浸 myself in evolutionary psychology: knowing the truth about your situation, at least in the form that evolutionary psychology provides it, doesn’t necessarily make your life any better. In fact, it can actually make it worse. You’re still stuck卡住了 in the natural human cycle of ultimately最终 futile徒然的 pleasure-seeking—what psychologists sometimes call “the hedonic/həˈdɑnɪk/享乐的 treadmill单调的工作/跑步机”—but now you have new reason to see the absurdity/əbˈsɜrdəti/荒谬 of it. In other words, now you see that it’s a treadmill, a treadmill specifically/spəˈsɪfɪkli/明确地 designed to keep you running, often without really getting anywhere—yet you keep running!**

**And powdered-sugar doughnuts are just the tip of一角 the iceberg冰山. I mean, the truth is, it’s not all that uncomfortable to be aware of意识到 the Darwinian/ˌdɑrˈwɪniən/ logic behind your lack of dietary/ˈdaɪəteri/饮食的 self-discipline/ˌself ˈdɪsəplɪn/. In fact, you may find in this logic a comforting安慰 excuse: it’s hard to fight Mother Nature, right? But evolutionary psychology also made me more aware of how illusion shapes other kinds of behavior, such as the way I treat other people and the way I, in various senses, treat myself. In these realms/rɛlmz/领域, Darwinian self-consciousness自我意识 was sometimes very uncomfortable.**

**Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, a meditation冥想 teacher in the Tibetan/tiˈbɛtən/藏语 Buddhist tradition, has said, “Ultimately/ˈʌltɪmətli/最终, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions苦恼 and the discomfort of being ruled by them.” What he meant is that if you want to liberate解放 yourself from the parts of the mind that keep you from realizing true happiness, you have to first become aware of them, which can be unpleasant.**

**Okay, fine; that’s a form of painful self-consciousness自我意识 that would be worthwhile值得的—the kind that leads ultimately最终 to deep happiness. But the kind I got from evolutionary psychology was the worst of both worlds: the painful self-consciousness without the deep happiness. I had both the discomfort of being aware of my mental afflictions苦恼 and the discomfort of being ruled by them.**

**Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life.” Well, with evolutionary psychology I felt I had found the truth. But, manifestly/ˈmæn.ə.fest.li/ 明显地, I had not found the way. Which was enough to make me wonder about another thing Jesus said: that the truth will set you free. I felt I had seen the basic truth about human nature, and I saw more clearly than ever how various illusions imprisoned监禁 me, but this truth wasn’t amounting等同 to a Get Out of Jail Free card.**

**So is there another version版本 of the truth out there that would set me free? No, I don’t think so. At least, I don’t think there’s an alternative/ɔːlˈtɜːrnətɪv/可供替代的 to the truth presented by science; natural selection, like it or not, is the process that created us. But some years after writing The Moral Animal, I did start to wonder if there was a way to operationalize/ɒpəˈreɪʃ(ə)n(ə)lʌɪz/操作化 the truth—a way to put the actual, scientific truth about human nature and the human condition条件 into a form that would not just identify and explain the illusions we labor苦干 under but would also help us liberate ourselves from them. I started wondering if this Western Buddhism I was hearing about might be that way. Maybe many of the Buddha’s teachings were saying essentially/ɪˈsenʃəli/本质上 the same thing modern psychological science says. And maybe meditation冥想 was in large part a different way of appreciating/əˈpriːʃieɪtɪŋ/欣赏 these truths—and, in addition此外, a way of actually doing something about them.**

**So in August 2003 I headed to前往 rural/ˈrʊrəl/乡村的 Massachusetts/ˌmæsəˈtʃusəts/马塞诸塞州 for my first silent meditation冥想 retreat躲避—a whole week devoted专心致志 to meditation and devoid缺乏 of such distractions分心 as email, news from the outside world, and speaking to other human beings.**

### The Truth about Mindfulness/ˈmaɪnd.fəl.nəs/正念认知

**You could be excused原谅 for doubting that a retreat静修 like this would yield/jiːld/屈服 anything very dramatic戏剧性的 or profound意义深远的. The retreat was, broadly speaking, in the tradition of “mindfulness meditation,”正念冥想 the kind of meditation that was starting to catch on in the West and that in the years since has gone mainstream主流. As commonly described, mindfulness—the thing mindfulness meditation aims to cultivate培养—isn’t very deep or exotic/ɪɡˈzɑːtɪk/异国情调的. To live mindfully正念 is to pay attention to, to be “mindful of”铭记 what’s happening in the here and now and to experience it in a clear, direct way, unclouded晴朗的/不受...困扰 by various mental obfuscations/ɒbfʌsˈkeɪʃ(ə)n/困扰. Stop and smell the roses.**

**This is an accurate精确的 description of mindfulness as far as it goes. But it doesn’t go very far. “Mindfulness,” as popularly conceived构想, is just the beginning of mindfulness.**

**And it’s in some ways a misleading beginning. If you delve翻找 into ancient古代的 Buddhist writings, you won’t find a lot of exhortations/ˌɛgˌzɔrˈteɪʃənz/规劝 to stop and smell the roses—and that’s true even if you focus on those writings that feature the word sati, the word that’s translated as “mindfulness.” Indeed, sometimes these writings seem to carry a very different message. The ancient Buddhist text known as The Four Foundations of Mindfulness—the closest thing there is to a Bible of Mindfulness—reminds us that our bodies are “full of various kinds of unclean things” and instructs/ɪnˈstrʌkts/指示 us to meditate冥想 on such bodily/ˈbɑːdɪli/人体的 ingredients成分 as “feces/ˈfiːsiːz/粪便, bile胆汁, phlegm/flem/痰, pus脓液, blood, sweat/swet/汗, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva/səˈlaɪvə/唾液, mucus/ˈmjuːkəs/鼻涕, fluid/ˈfluːɪd/液体 in the joints/dʒɔɪnts/关节, urine/ˈjʊrɪn/尿.” It also calls for us to imagine our bodies “one day, two days, three days dead—bloated/ˈbloʊtɪd/膨胀, livid乌青色的, and festering溃烂/化脓.”**

**I’m not aware of意识到 any bestselling books on mindfulness meditation called Stop and Smell the Feces/ˈfiːsiːz/粪便. And I’ve never heard a meditation teacher recommend推荐 that I meditate冥想 on my bile胆汁, phlegm/flem/痰, and pus脓液 or on the rotting/ˈrɑːtɪŋ/腐烂 corpse/kɔːrps/尸体 that I will someday be. What is presented today as an ancient meditative沉思的 tradition is actually a selective选择性的 rendering翻译 of an ancient meditative沉思的/ tradition, in some cases carefully manicured/ˈmænɪkjʊrd/修剪.**

**There’s no scandal/ˈskændl/丑行 here. There’s nothing wrong with modern interpreters/ɪnˈtɜrprətərz/口译员 of Buddhism being selective—even, sometimes, creative—in what they present as Buddhism. All spiritual traditions evolve/iˈvɑːlv/发展, adapting使适应 to time and place, and the Buddhist teachings that find an audience today in the United States and Europe are a product of such evolution进化.**

**The main thing, for our purposes, is that this evolution—the evolution that has produced a distinctively显著地 Western, twenty-first-century version of Buddhism—hasn’t severed the connection between current现在的 practice and ancient thought. Modern mindfulness meditation isn’t exactly the same as ancient mindfulness meditation, but the two share a common philosophical foundation基础. If you follow the underlying隐含的/根本的 logic of either of them far enough, you will find a dramatic戏剧性的 claim: that we are, metaphorically/ˌmɛtəˈfɒrɪk(ə)li/隐喻地 speaking, living in the Matrix. However mundane/mʌnˈdeɪn/单调的 mindfulness meditation may sometimes sound听起来好像, it is a practice that, if pursued追求 rigorously/ˈrɪgərəsli/严格的, can let you see what Morpheus莫菲斯 says the red pill will let you see. Namely即, “how deep the rabbit hole goes.”**

**On that first meditation retreat静修, I had some pretty powerful experiences—powerful enough to make me want to see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. So I read more about Buddhist philosophy, and talked to experts on Buddhism, and eventually went on more meditation retreats, and established/ɪˈstæblɪʃt/确立 a daily meditation practice.**

**All of this made it clearer to me why The Matrix had come to be known as a “dharma/ˈdɑːrmə/达摩佛法 movie.” Though evolutionary psychology had already convinced使确信 me that people are by nature pretty deluded欺骗/迷惑, Buddhism, it turned out, painted an even more dramatic戏剧化 picture. In the Buddhist view, the delusion错觉 touches everyday perceptions感知 and thoughts in ways subtler/ˈsʌtələr/微妙的 and more pervasive/pərˈveɪsɪv/普遍的 than I had imagined. And in ways that made sense to me. In other words, this kind of delusion, it seemed to me, could be explained as the natural product of a brain that had been engineered/ˌendʒɪˈnɪrd/设计制造 by natural selection. The more I looked into Buddhism, the more radical根本的 it seemed, but the more I examined it in the light of根据 modern psychology, the more plausible/ˈplɔːzəbl/看似合理的 it seemed. The real-life Matrix, the one in which we’re actually embedded嵌入的, came to seem more like the one in the movie—not quite as mind-bending扭曲,费解 maybe, but profoundly深刻地 deceiving欺骗 and ultimately/ˈʌltɪmətli/最终 oppressive压迫的, and something that humanity urgently紧急地 needs to escape.**

**The good news is the other thing I came to believe: if you want to escape from the Matrix, Buddhist practice and philosophy offer powerful hope. Buddhism isn’t alone in this promise. There are other spiritual traditions that address the human predicament with insight and wisdom. But Buddhist meditation, along with its underlying philosophy, addresses that predicament/prɪˈdɪkəmənt/窘境 in a strikingly/'straɪkɪŋli/惊人的 direct and comprehensive综合的 way. Buddhism offers an explicit/ɪkˈsplɪsɪt/明确的 diagnosis of the problem and a cure. And the cure, when it works, brings not just happiness but clarity/ˈklærəti/清晰 of vision: the actual truth about things, or at least something way, way closer to that than our everyday view of them.**

**Some people who have taken up开始 meditation in recent years have done so for essentially本质上 therapeutic/ˌθerəˈpjuːtɪk/治疗的 reasons. They practice mindfulness-based stress强调 reduction/rɪˈdʌkʃn/减少 or focus on some specific personal problem. They may have no idea that the kind of meditation冥想 they’re practicing can be a deeply spiritual endeavor/ɪnˈdɛvər/努力 and can transform their view of the world. They are, without knowing it, near the threshold/ˈθreʃhoʊld/门槛 of a basic choice, a choice that only they can make. As Morpheus says to Neo, “I can only show you the door. You’re the one that has to walk through it.” This book is an attempt to show people the door, give them some idea of what lies beyond it, and explain, from a scientific standpoint立场, why what lies beyond it has a stronger claim to being real than the world they’re familiar with.**

## 2 Paradoxes/ˈpɛrəˌdɑksɪz/悖论 of Meditation冥想

**I’m not supposed to tell you about my first big success at meditating. The reason is that there isn’t supposed to be success at meditating. As any good meditation teacher will tell you, if you talk about meditation in terms of success or failure, you’re misunderstanding what meditation is.**

**Here I must depart离开 from orthodoxy/ˈɔːrθədɑːksi/正统. I wouldn’t advocate/ˈædvəkeɪt , ˈædvəkət/提倡 meditation if I didn’t think there was something people could achieve by it. And if people don’t achieve that something, well, that would constitute failure, right? As in:比如 the opposite of success.**

**Granted的确, it may be best for people who are meditating to not think about succeeding, but that’s because thinking about succeeding gets in the way of success! And, granted, if you do achieve meditative “success,” that may lead to a new frame框架 of mind that is less caught up赶上 in the pursuit追求 of success than your old frame of mind—less心不在焉 relentlessly/rɪˈlɛntləsli/无情地 focused on achieving certain kinds of distant material客观存在的 goals, more aware of意识到 the here and now.**

**In sum:总之 you can best achieve success at meditation by not pursuing success, and achieving this success may mean caring less about success, at least as success is conventionally按惯例 defined. If this sounds unbearably难以忍受 paradoxical/ˌpærəˈdɑːksɪkl/矛盾, maybe you should quit reading here, because this won’t be the last time we find paradox/ˈpærədɑːks/悖论 in Buddhist practice or Buddhist teachings. Then again, there’s paradoxical stuff in modern physics (an electron/ɪˈlektrɑːn/电子 is both a particle粒子 and a wave), and modern physics works fine. So you might as well keep reading.**

**Anyway, before I violate/ˈvaɪəleɪt/违背 protocol/ˈproʊtəkɑːl/规程 by telling you about my first big “success” as a meditator, I have to commit another violation of protocol by noting what a naturally bad meditator I am. That you shouldn’t talk about how bad you are at meditating is a straightforward corollary/ˈkɔːrəleri/推论 of the axiom/ˈæksiəm/公理 that there’s no such thing as succeeding or failing at meditating. And if I’m violating the axiom, I might as well violate its corollary, so here goes.**
【刘福波：That you shouldn't talk about how bad you are at meditating is a straightforward corollary of the axiom that thert's no such thing as succeeding or failing at meditating.没有所谓成功和失败的冥想。这一条很重要。】

**Suppose you ranked排列 all the people in the world in terms of their likelihood可能 of picking up mindfulness正念减压法 meditation easily—sitting down, focusing on the breath, and slowly sinking下沉 into a state of calm, dispassionate/dɪsˈpæʃənət/不动感情的 observation. At one end of the spectrum/ˈspektrəm/普-范围 you’d have Bobby Knight鲍比·奈特—the college basketball coach famous for his red, furious face and for once flinging/ˈflɪŋɪŋ/抛 a chair onto a basketball court/kɔːrt/. At the other end you’d have, I don’t know, the Dalai Lama or maybe the late Mister Rogers. On this spectrum, I would be much closer to Bobby Knight than to the Dalai Lama or Mister Rogers. I’ve never thrown/θroʊn/ a chair onto a basketball court, but I threw a chicken leg at a dinner guest when I was four and a baseball棒球 bat/bæt/球棒 at a brother-in-law when I was twelve. Happily, my penchant/ˈpentʃənt/嗜好 for throwing/ˈθroʊɪŋ/ things at people has waned/weɪnd/减弱 with age, but the underlying作为…的原因 volatility/ˌvɑləˈtɪləti/波动 hasn’t entirely disappeared. And volatility doesn’t smooth/smuːð/抚平 the path路径 toward mindfulness正念.**

**Plus (and perhaps relatedly相关地) there’s my attitude toward other human beings, which could get in the way of the metta慈爱-巴利文, or loving-kindness, that you’re supposed to deploy调动 during a certain kind of meditation. Michael Kinsley迈克尔·金斯利, who was editor of the New Republic新共和国周刊 when I worked there many years ago, suggested, not even half-jokingly, that I should write a column/ˈkɑːləm/专栏 called “The Misanthrope/ˈmɪsənθroʊp/厌世者.”**

**Actually, I think that oversimplifies/ˌoʊvərˈsɪmplɪfaɪz/ my problem. I don’t have a hostile/ˈhɑːstl/怀有敌意的 disposition/ˌdɪspəˈzɪʃn/倾向 toward humankind per se本质上. In fact, I feel quite warmly toward humankind. It’s individual humans I have trouble with. I’m prone/proʊn/有做...的倾向 to a certain skepticism/ˈskeptɪsɪzəm/怀疑论 about people’s motives and character, and this critical appraisal/əˈpreɪzl/评价 can harden更严厉更硬 into enduringly持久地 harsh严厉的 judgment. I’m particularly尤其 tough on people who disagree with me on moral/ˈmɔːrəl/道德的 or political政治的 issues that I consider important. Once I place these people on the other side of a critical ideological/ˌaɪdiəˈlɑːdʒɪkl/思想体系的 boundary边界, I can have trouble thinking generous/ˈdʒenərəs/大方的 and sympathetic/ˌsɪmpəˈθetɪk/同情的 thoughts about them.**

**On top of all this, there’s my attention-deficit/ˈdefɪsɪt/缺少 disorder疾病.注意缺陷障碍 Meditation is hard enough even if you have normal skills of concentration/ˌkɑːnsnˈtreɪʃn/专心. I don’t.**

**Here’s an interesting thing about this hypothetical/ˌhaɪpəˈθetɪkl/假设的 spectrum/ˈspektrəm/范围 of people ranked排列 from most likely meditators to least likely meditators: the least likely meditators are the people who seem to most need the benefits益处 of meditation! Personally, I think that if the Dalai Lama had never started meditating, he’d still be a pretty easy guy to get along with. I don’t think he was born with a lot of rough edges小毛病 that needed sanding down打磨. So too with Mister Rogers. Bobby Knight and I are another story altogether完全.**

**Hence因此 another paradox/ˈpærədɑːks/悖论 of meditation: the problems that meditation can help you overcome often make it hard to meditate in the first place. Yes, meditation may help you lengthen/ˈleŋθən/延长 your attention span跨度, dampen/ˈdæmpən/抑制 your rage愤怒, and view your fellow human beings less judgmentally. Unfortunately, a short attention span, a hot temper, and a penchant/ˈpentʃənt/嗜好 for harsh严厉的 judgment may slow your progress along the meditative path路径. This is bad news for me.**

**But there’s an upside正面 to my possessing/pəˈzesɪŋ/拥有 this rich array/əˈreɪ/大量 of impediments/ɪmˈpɛdəmənts/障碍 to meditation. They make me a good laboratory rat, a kind of stand-in代替 for the rest of humankind. After all, even if I score/skɔːr/得分 higher on these scales/skeɪlz/范围 than the average平均的 person, most people score much higher on them than is optimal/ˈɑːptɪməl/最佳的. And it may well be that the average person scores higher on them than used to be the case. Technologies/tɛkˈnɑlədʒiz/ of distraction分散注意力 have made attention deficits/ˈdɛfɪsɪts/缺少 more common. And there’s something about the modern environment—something technological/ˌteknəˈlɑːdʒɪkl/技术的 or cultural or political or all of the above—that seems conducive/kənˈduːsɪv/有利于 to harsh严厉的 judgment and ready rage暴怒. Just look at all the tribalism/ˈtraɪbəlɪzəm/部落主义—the discord不一致 and even open conflict冲突 along religious/rɪˈlɪdʒəs/宗教冲突的, ethnic民族的, national, and ideological/ˌaɪdiəˈlɑːdʒɪkl/思想体系的 lines.思想路线 More and more, it seems, groups of people define their identity/aɪˈdentəti/身份 in terms of依据 sharp/ʃɑːrp/尖锐的 opposition反对 to other groups of people.**

**I consider this tribalism/ˈtraɪbəlɪzəm/部落主义 the biggest problem of our time. I think it could undo拆开 millennia/məˈlɛniə/千年 of movement toward global integration/ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃn/一体化, unravel/ʌnˈrævl/解体 the social web just when technology has brought the prospect/ˈprɑːspekt/展望 of a cohesive/koʊˈhiːsɪv/使凝聚的 planetary/ˈplænəteri/行星的 community within reach. Given that the world is still loaded with满载 nuclear weapons and that biotechnology/ˌbaɪoʊtekˈnɑːlədʒi/生物技术 is opening a Pandora’s box of new weaponry兵器, you can imagine our tribalistic部落的 impulses/ˈɪmpəlsɪz/冲击 ushering/ˈʌʃərɪŋ/把...引向 in a truly dark age.**

**Or maybe I’m getting carried away忘乎所以. Anyway, I’ll spare/sper/放过 you the full-length, high-volume/ˈvɑːljuːm/容量 version of my sermon/ˈsɜːrmən/布道 about our imperiled/ɪmˈperəld/危及 planet. You don’t have to share my apocalyptic/əˌpɑːkəˈlɪptɪk/似末日的 fears to think that it would be good for the world if meditation could help more people overcome the mental tendencies倾向 that sustain/səˈsteɪn/维持 the more belligerent/bəˈlɪdʒərənt/好战的 forms of tribalism/ˈtraɪbəlɪzəm/部落主义.  That’s what makes me such an exemplary模范的 laboratory rat. I am a walking embodiment/ɪmˈbɑːdimənt/体现 of what I consider to be the biggest problem facing humanity. I am, in microcosm/ˈmaɪkroʊkɑːzəm/缩影, what’s wrong with the world.**

**My career as a laboratory rat began in earnest认真的 when I went to that retreat疗养 in rural/ˈrʊrəl/乡村的 Massachusetts/ˌmæsəˈtʃusəts/马塞诸塞州 in August 2003. I had decided that meditation was worth exploring, but I had learned that casual/ˈkæʒuəl/随便的 experimentation/ɪkˌsperɪmenˈteɪʃn/实验 wouldn’t get a person like me very far. Boot camp训练营 was in order. So I signed up签约 for a seven-day retreat七天的静修 at the Insight Meditation Society内观禅修社, auspiciously/ɔs'pɪʃəslɪ/吉祥地 located on Pleasant Street in the town of Barre/ˈbɛri/巴尔. There, every day, I would do sitting meditation for a total of five and a half hours and walking meditation for about that long. As for the rest of the day, when you add three (silent) meals, a one-hour “yogi/ˈjoʊɡi/瑜伽师 job” in the morning (vacuuming/ˈvækjuːmɪŋ/吸尘 hallways走廊, in my case), and listening to one of the teachers give a “dharma/ˈdɑːrmə/佛法 talk” in the evening, you’ve pretty much exhausted/ɪɡˈzɔːstɪd/ the day.至于一天剩下的时间，当你加上三顿（无声的）饭，早上一个小时的“瑜珈工作”（我的例子是打扫走廊），晚上听一位老师讲“佛法”，你一整天都精疲力竭了。 Which is good, because if there was time you needed to waste, the traditional means of wasting it wouldn’t be available/əˈveɪləbl/可获得的. There was no TV, no internet, no news from the outside world. And you’re not supposed to bring books to read or do any writing. (That last rule I secretly broke so that I’d have a record of events. I wasn’t planning to write this book at that point, but I’m a writer, and I consider pretty much everything I do grist有利的事/面粉 for my mill磨坊/工厂.) And, of course, no talking.**
【刘福波：这是“打七”，是佛教禅宗的修行方法。202111231529】

**This daily regimen/ˈredʒɪmən/养生 may not sound taxing/ˈtæksɪŋ/费力的, since, aside from除了 the yogi job, it doesn’t involve涉及 anything we normally call work. But the first couple of days were pretty excruciating/ɪkˈskruːʃieɪtɪŋ/折磨人的. Have you ever tried sitting on a cushion/ˈkʊʃn/坐垫 with your legs crossed, focusing on your breath? It’s no picnic,不容易 especially if you’re as bad at focusing on your breath as I am. Early in the retreat, I could go a whole forty-five-minute meditation session课 without ever sustaining/səˈsteɪnɪŋ/维持 focus for ten consecutive/kənˈsekjətɪv/连续的 breaths. And I know, because I was counting! Time and again, after I counted three or four breaths, my mind would wander开小差, and then eventually最后 I’d realize that I had lost count—or, in some cases, that I was still going through the motions动作 of counting but was in fact thinking about something else and not consciously有意识地 feeling the breaths.**

**It didn’t help that I got mad at myself every time this happened—madder and madder as the first couple of days wore on慢慢地过去. Naturally, my anger then extended/ɪkˈstendɪd/延伸 to all the people who seemed to be doing better than I was. Which was around eighty people—that is, everybody. Imagine being stuck困于 for a week with eighty people who are doing better than you! People who succeed while you fail—or at least “succeed” while you “fail.”**

### My Big Breakthrough

My big breakthrough came on the fifth morning of the retreat. After breakfast I consumed/kənˈsuːmd/吃喝 a bit too much of the instant速溶的 coffee I had brought, and as I tried to meditate冥想 I felt the classic symptom/ˈsɪmptəm/症状 of overcaffeination: a very unpleasant tension/ˈtenʃn/紧张 in my jaw下巴 that made me feel like grinding/ˈɡraɪndɪŋ/磨 my teeth. This feeling kept intruding/ɪnˈtruːdɪŋ/打扰 on my focus, and, after trying for a while to fight the intrusion打扰, I finally just surrendered to it and shifted my attention to the tension in my jaw. Or maybe it wasn’t so much a shifting of attention as an expansion膨胀 of attention—staying conscious有意识的 of my breath but letting it recede退后 into the background as this annoying/əˈnɔɪɪŋ/烦人的 jaw sensation/senˈseɪʃn/感觉 moved to center stage.

This sort of readjustment/ˌriːəˈdʒʌstmənt/调整 of attention, by the way, is a perfectly fine thing to do. In mindfulness meditation as it’s typically典型的 taught, the point of focusing on your breath isn’t just to focus on your breath. It’s to stabilize your mind, to free it of its normal preoccupations/priˌɑkjəˈpeɪʃənz/专注 so you can observe things that are happening in a clear, unhurried从容不迫, less reactive反应性 way. And “things that are happening” emphatically/ɪmˈfætɪkli/强调 includes things happening inside your mind. Feelings arise within you—sadness, anxiety/æŋˈzaɪəti/焦虑, annoyance/əˈnɔɪəns/恼怒, relief轻松, joy—and you try to experience them from a different vantage/ˈvæntɪdʒ/优势 point than is usual, neither clinging/ˈklɪŋɪŋ/依附 to the good feelings nor running away from the bad ones, but rather just experiencing them straightforwardly直截了当 and observing them. This altered改变了的 perspective思考方法 can be the beginning of a fundamental基本的 and enduring持久的 change in your relationship to your feelings; you can, if all goes well, cease to停止 be their slave.

After devoting/dɪˈvoʊtɪŋ/投入 some attention to the overcaffeinated feeling in my jaw, I suddenly had an angle/ˈæŋɡl/角度 on my interior内部 life that I’d never had before. I remember thinking something like, “Yes, the grinding/ˈɡraɪndɪŋ/无休止 sensation感觉 is still there—the sensation I typically通常 define as unpleasant. But that sensation is down there in my jaw, and that’s not where I am. I’m up here in my head.” I was no longer identifying认同 with the feeling; I was viewing it objectively客观地, I guess you could say. In the space of a moment it had entirely lost its grip紧抓 on me. It was a very strange thing to have an unpleasant feeling cease to不再 be unpleasant without really going away.

There is a paradox/ˈpærədɑːks/悖论 here. (Don’t say I didn’t warn you!) When I first expanded扩大 my attention to encompass/ɪnˈkʌmpəs/包含 the obnoxiously/əbˈnɒkʃəslɪ/讨厌的 intrusive/ɪnˈtruːsɪv/侵入的 jaw-grinding/ˈɡraɪndɪŋ/无休止的 sensation感觉, this involved relaxing my resistance/rɪˈzɪstəns/反抗 to the sensation. I was, in a sense,从某种意义上说 accepting, even embracing拥抱 a feeling that I had been trying to keep at a distance. But the result of this closer proximity/prɑːkˈsɪməti/接近 to the feeling was to acquire获得 a kind of distance from it—a certain degree程度 of detachment/dɪˈtætʃmənt/超脱 (or, as some meditation teachers prefer更喜欢, for somewhat technical reasons,某种技术原因 to put it说实话, “nonattachment”/ˌnɒnəˈtætʃmənt/超脱性). This is something that can happen again and again via/ˈvaɪə/通过 meditation: accepting, even embracing, an unpleasant feeling can give you a critical distance from it that winds up diminishing/dɪˈmɪnɪʃɪŋ/减少 the unpleasantness.

In fact, one thing I occasionally/əˈkeɪʒnəli/偶尔地 do when I’m feeling very sad—and this is something you can experiment with even if you’ve never meditated/ˈmedɪteɪtɪd/冥想—is sit down, close my eyes, and study the sadness: accept its presence/ˈprezns/存在 and just observe how it actually makes me feel. For example, it’s kind of interesting that, though I may not be close to actually crying, the feeling of sadness does have a strong presence right around the parts of my eyes that would get active活跃的 if I did start crying. I’d never noticed that before meditating on sadness. This careful observation of sadness, combined/kəmˈbaɪnd/ with与…结合 a kind of acceptance/əkˈseptəns/接受 of it, does, in my experience, make it less unpleasant.

Now, here is a question that is fundamental/ˌfʌndəˈmentl/根本: Which, if either, of my two perceptions/pərˈsɛpʃənz/感知 was “truer真实的”—when the feeling felt unpleasant, or when the unpleasantness subsided/səbˈsaɪdɪd/平息 and the feeling became, for practical/ˈpræktɪkl/ purposes实际目的, neutral/ˈnuːtrəl/中立的? To put it another way: Was the initial/ɪˈnɪʃl/最初的 unpleasantness in any sense无论如何 an illusion/ɪˈluːʒn/幻觉? Certainly, by adopting/əˈdɑːptɪŋ/采取 another perspective/pərˈspektɪv/态度, I made it disappear—and that’s something that’s often true of what we call illusions: shifting your perspective/pərˈspektɪv/态度 dispels/dɪˈspelz/驱散 them. But are there any additional/əˈdɪʃənl/附加的 grounds/ɡraʊndz/理由 for thinking of it as an illusion?

This question goes way beyond my own little episodes/ˈɛpəˌsoʊdz/插曲 of transcending/trænˈsendɪŋ/超出 overcaffeination过度疲劳量 and melancholy/ˈmelənkɑːli/悲哀的. It applies/əˈplaɪz/, 它适用于in principle,从理论上说 to all negative feelings: fears, anxieties/æŋˈzaɪətiz/焦虑, loathing/ˈloʊðɪŋ/厌恶, self-loathing, and more. Imagine if our negative feelings, or at least lots of them, turned out to be illusions, and we could dispel/dɪˈspel/驱散 them by just contemplating/ˈkɑːntəmpleɪtɪŋ/沉思 them from a particular vantage/ˈvæntɪdʒ/优势 point.

### Pain That Doesn’t Hurt

There’s no doubt that meditation training has allowed some people to become essentially/ɪˈsenʃəli/本质上 indifferent/ɪnˈdɪfrənt/漠不关心的 to what otherwise/ˈʌðərwaɪz/之外 would have been unbearable/ʌnˈberəbl/无法忍受的 pain. In June of 1963 a monk和尚 named Thich Quang Duc staged上演 a public protest抗议 of the South Vietnamese/viɛtnɑˈmis/ government’s treatment of Buddhists. On a cushion/ˈkʊʃn/软垫 placed in a Saigon street, he assumed/əˈsuːmd/呈现 the lotus/ˈloʊtəs/莲花 position. After another monk poured/pɔːrd/倾倒 gasoline/ˈɡæsəliːn/汽油 over him, Duc said, “Before closing my eyes and moving towards the vision of the Buddha, I respectfully plead乞求 to President Ngo Dinh Diem to take a mind of compassion/kəmˈpæʃn/同情 towards the people of the nation and implement/ˈɪmplɪmənt/使生效 religious/rɪˈlɪdʒəs/宗教的 equality/iˈkwɑːləti/平等 to maintain/meɪnˈteɪn/维持 the strength of the homeland eternally/ɪˈtɜrnəli/永久的.” Then he lit a match. The journalist/ˈdʒɜːrnəlɪst/新闻工作者 David Halberstam哈伯斯塔姆, who witnessed/ˈwɪtnəst/见证 the event, wrote, “As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered/ˈʌtərd/说出 a sound, his outward/ˈaʊtwərd/表面的 composure/kəmˈpoʊʒər/镇定 in sharp鲜明的 contrast/ˈkɑːntræst , kənˈtræst/对比 to the wailing/ˈweɪlɪŋ/哀嚎 people around him.”

Now, you might argue that Duc, far from liberating himself from an illusion, was actually suffering from an illusion. After all, the fact is that he was burning to death. So if he lacked the sensation we normally associate with burning to death—a sensation that carries intense pain and triggers alarm that would strike most of us as appropriate—then isn’t there some sense in which he wasn’t getting the picture?

The question I’m circling around—which of our “normal” feelings, thoughts, and perceptions are in some sense illusions—is important for two reasons. One reason is simple and practical: obviously, if many unpleasant feelings—feelings of anxiety, fear, self-loathing, melancholy, and so on—are in some sense illusions, and we can use meditation to dispel them or at least weaken their grip on us, that’s news you can use. The other reason is at first glance more academic, but it ultimately has a kind of practical value as well. Figuring out when our feelings mislead us will help shed light on the question of whether the Buddhist view of the mind, and of the mind’s relationship to reality, is as crazy as it sometimes sounds. Is perceived reality, or a sizable chunk of it, really an illusion?

This question takes us into depths of Buddhist philosophy that aren’t often plumbed in popular accounts of meditation. Naturally enough, these accounts tend to focus on things with a near-term payoff—stress reduction, boosting self-esteem, and so on—without getting deeply into the philosophical context in which Buddhist meditation arose and within which it has flourished. Using meditation this way, as a purely therapeutic device that doesn’t deeply change your view of reality, is a perfectly fine thing to do. It’s good for you, and it will probably be good for the world.

Still, using meditation this way isn’t, by itself, taking the red pill. Taking the red pill means asking basic questions about the relationship of the perceiver to the perceived and examining the underpinnings of our normal view of reality. If you’re thinking seriously about taking the red pill, you’ll be curious as to whether the Buddhist view of the world “works” not just in a therapeutic sense but in a more philosophical sense. Does this Buddhist perspective, with its seemingly topsy-turvy conception of what’s real and what’s not, make any sense in light of modern science? That’s the question I’ll take up in the next chapter—and, indeed, in much of the rest of this book. As we’ll see, this question, though important on sheerly philosophical grounds, also has implications for how we live our lives—implications that, though in a sense practical, are probably better described as “spiritual” than as “therapeutic.”

But first a word of caution. Strictly speaking, there is no “Buddhist view of the world.” Buddhism began to split into different schools of interpretation not long after it arose, around the middle of the first millennium BCE. As a result, just as there are Catholic and Protestant Christians and Sunni and Shia Muslims, there are distinct branches of Buddhist thought that differ on particular points of doctrine.

he most basic division in Buddhism is between the Theravada school and the Mahayana school. My own meditative tradition, Vipassana, derives from the Theravada lineage. It is within the Mahayana lineage (to which Quang Duc belonged) that you find the most radically broad conception of illusion. Some Mahayana Buddhists even subscribe to a “mind-only” doctrine that, in its more extreme incarnations, dismisses the things we “perceive” via consciousness as, pretty literally, figments of our imagination. This strand of Buddhist thought—the strand that most obviously resonates with the movie The Matrix—isn’t dominant within Mahayana Buddhism, much less within Buddhism at large. But even mainstream Buddhist thinkers accept some version of the concept of emptiness, a subtle idea that is hard to capture in a few words (or in many words) but certainly holds, at a minimum, that the things we see when we look out on the world have less in the way of distinct and substantial existence than they seem to have.

And then there is the famous Buddhist idea that the self—you know, your self, my self—is an illusion. In this view, the “you” that you think of as thinking your thoughts, feeling your feelings, and making your decisions doesn’t really exist.
{In Mahayana Buddhism, for reasons I’ll touch on in chapter 13, the term emptiness is often taken to include the concept of not-self. But in Theravada Buddhism, not-self is typically treated separately from any broader notion of emptiness (a notion that is less prominent in Theravada thinking anyway). Throughout this book, I use the terms not-self and emptiness in a nonoverlapping way; emptiness will be used more narrowly than in the Mahayana tradition, referring only to the world “out there.”}

If you put these two fundamental Buddhist ideas together—the idea of not-self and the idea of emptiness—you have a radical proposition: neither the world inside you nor the world outside you is anything like it seems.

Both of these ideas would strike most people as dubious, if not crazy. Then again, since the premise of these ideas is that people are naturally deluded, it would seem perverse to let people’s natural reactions to them keep us from exploring them. This book is in no small part an exploration of these two ideas, and what I hope to show is that they make a lot of sense. Both our natural view of the world “out there” and our natural view of the world “in here”—the world inside our heads—are deeply misleading. What’s more, failing to see these two worlds clearly does lead, as Buddhism holds, to a lot of suffering. And meditation can help us see them more clearly.

When I say we’re going to be exploring the scientific foundation of a Buddhist worldview, I don’t mean “scientific foundation” in the sense of scientific evidence that meditation can reduce suffering. If you want such evidence, there are lots of studies, readily available and widely reported, that seem to show as much. And I don’t mean “scientific foundation” only in the sense of what’s going on in the brain when you’re meditating and starting to change your view of reality—though I will, to be sure, get into some of the more important brain-scan studies.

I mean “scientific foundation” in the sense of using all the tools of modern psychology to look at such questions as these: Why, and in what particular ways, are human beings naturally deluded? How exactly does the delusion work? How does delusion make us suffer? How does it make us make other people suffer? Why would the Buddhist prescription for dispelling the delusion—in particular, the meditative part of that prescription—work? And what would it mean for it to work fully? In other words, does the elusive state that is said to lie at the culmination of the meditative path—sometimes called enlightenment—really qualify for that term? What would it be like to see the world with perfect clarity?

And speaking of the world: Is saving the world—keeping the psychology of tribalism from covering the planet in chaos and bloodshed—really a matter of just clarifying the vision of the world’s people? I shouldn’t say “just,” because, obviously, if delusion is deeply ingrained in us, then dispelling it will take work. Still, it would be nice to know if the struggle for enduring peace is also the struggle for truth; as long as we’re undertaking a task as Herculean as saving the world, it would be great to kill two birds with one stone! It would also be nice to think that when people pursue the path to liberation—use meditation to try and see the world more clearly, and in the process reduce their suffering—they are helping humanity broadly, that the quest for individual salvation advances the quest for social salvation.

The first step in this epic inquiry is to take a closer look at our feelings: pain, pleasure, fear, anxiety, love, lust, and so on. Feelings play a very big role in shaping our perceptions and guiding us through life—bigger than most people realize. Are they reliable guides? That’s a question we’ll start to examine in the next chapter.
