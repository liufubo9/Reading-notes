# A Note to Readers
Any book with a title like Why Buddhism Is True should have some careful qualification

##qualification

noun UK  /ˌkwɒl.ɪ.fɪˈkeɪ.ʃən/ US  /ˌkwɑː.lə.fəˈkeɪ.ʃən/qualification noun (TRAINING)
B1 [ C ]an official record showing that you have finished a training course or have the necessary skills, etc.
合格证明，资格证书。B2 [ C or U ]an ability, characteristic, or experience that makes you suitable for a particular job or activity
资历，资格；条件；合格性。}

somewhere along the way. We might as well get that over with:

1. I’m not talking about the “supernatural” or more exotically metaphysical parts of Buddhism—reincarnation, for example—but rather about the naturalistic parts: ideas that fall squarely within modern psychology and philosophy. That said, I am talking about some of Buddhism’s more extraordinary, even radical, claims—claims that, if you take them seriously, could revolutionize your view of yourself and of the world. This book is intended to get you to take these claims seriously.
